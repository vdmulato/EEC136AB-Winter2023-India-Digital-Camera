# DigitalCamera
This is the place where we are going to follow up with weekly updates of the project

Week 1 

First design with considerations taken on what parts to use for prototypes and final product. Ordering of the parts. Refer to week 1 slides for more information.

Week 2 

Start of prototype V0 the goal of this prototype is to familiarize ourselves with the Psoc enviroment and ADC implementation. For this first prototype we will be using 
a single photodiode and read its output. Basically we will be building a voltmeter this will help us to be familiar with the code for the next step of implementing the
multiplexers with an array of photodiodes.

Week 3 

Began building prototype board and testing photodiodes. Tested prototype with PSoC ADC pins. Power consumption calculations and researched solutions. Tested multiplexer implementation to circuit board. Created OrCad design and PCB library for photodiode sensor.

Week 4

Built a 2x2 photodiode prototype to display the first image. Created a MatLab code to display the 4 pixels in grayscale. Debugged errors in prototype circuit. Created alpha report, following the report requirements.

Week 5

Received PSoC boards and began assembly. Finalized Beta Prototype Design. Improved and optimized Matlab code. Translating Design into Altium. Intend to order PCB for photodiodes by mid next week. Filmed presentation video.

Week 6

Assembled PSoC boards. Tested out the ADC component. Improved and optimized Matlab code. Finalized Altium design for the photodiodes.

Week 7

Sent out Photodiode board PCB to Smart Prototyping. Worked on code for LCD display to show camera indication. Ordered all parts still missing for assembly. Worked on beta prototype code. Build a circuit that resembles the beta PCB to perform testing ahead of time.

Week 8

Received Photodiode board PCB. Worked on code for LCD display to show camera indication. Received all parts for assembly. Worked on beta prototype code. Start the PCB assembly.

Week 9

Put together Photodiode board PCB. Worked on code for converting the values and displaying into an array. Put together beta prototype with modifications. Came up with ideas of future improvement of a camera.

Week 10

Created robust enclosure. Added lens to the photodiode array to improve light exposure. Assembled list of ideas for future improvements. Added internal battery with switch. Presented design. Began working on Final Report
